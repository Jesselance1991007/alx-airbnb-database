# Task 0: Complex Queries with Joins

This task focuses on practicing SQL join operations in **MySQL** using the Airbnb database.  
We explored how to retrieve combined data across related tables using different join techniques.

---

## What Was Done

1. **INNER JOIN**
   - Combined the `bookings` table with the `users` table.  
   - Retrieved only the rows where a booking has a valid user.  
   - Purpose: To see which user made each booking.

2. **LEFT JOIN**
   - Combined the `properties` table with the `reviews` table.  
   - Returned all properties, including those without reviews.  
   - Purpose: To ensure we capture properties with and without feedback.

3. **FULL OUTER JOIN (Simulated with UNION)**
   - MySQL does not directly support `FULL OUTER JOIN`.  
   - We simulated it by combining two `LEFT JOIN` queries with a `UNION`.  
   - This returned:
     - All users with or without bookings.  
     - All bookings with or without linked users.  
   - Purpose: To capture every possible relationship, even if some data is missing.

## How It Works

- **INNER JOIN** â†’ Keeps only matching rows from both tables.  
- **LEFT JOIN** â†’ Keeps all rows from the left table, with `NULL` values where no match exists.  
- **FULL OUTER JOIN (via UNION)** â†’ Combines unmatched rows from both sides, giving a complete dataset.

## How to Run

1. Write the queries in a file called `joins_queries.sql`.  
2. Save the file inside your `task_0/` folder.  
3. Run the file against your MySQL database:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p alx_airbnb < task_0/joins_queries.sql

   # Task 1 â€“ Practice Subqueries

This task focuses on writing **subqueries** in SQL using the Airbnb database schema.  
We will implement both **non-correlated** and **correlated** subqueries.

---

## ðŸ“‚ File
- `subqueries.sql` â†’ contains all subquery queries for this task.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What are Subqueries?
A **subquery** is a query nested inside another SQL query. It helps filter, calculate, or compare data.  
There are two main types:
1. **Non-Correlated Subquery** â†’ runs independently of the outer query.  
2. **Correlated Subquery** â†’ depends on values from the outer query.

# Task 2 â€“ Aggregations and Window Functions

This task focuses on using **SQL aggregation functions** and **window functions** to analyze Airbnb data.  
You will practice summarizing data with `COUNT` and ranking results with `ROW_NUMBER` and `RANK`.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `aggregations_and_window_functions.sql` â†’ contains all queries for this task.  
- `README.md` â†’ documentation and explanations.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Concepts You Need

### ðŸ”¹ Aggregation Functions
Aggregation functions summarize data across rows, usually combined with `GROUP BY`.

- `COUNT()` â†’ counts rows  
- `SUM()` â†’ adds values  
- `AVG()` â†’ calculates averages  
- `MIN()` / `MAX()` â†’ smallest / largest value  

âœ… Example: Count total bookings made by each user
```sql
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS total_bookings
FROM Bookings
GROUP BY user_id;
